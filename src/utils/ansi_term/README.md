# ansi_term

![CI](https://github.com/ziglibs/ansi_term/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Zig library for dealing with ANSI Terminals (escape codes, styles, etc.)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This library was renamed from `ansi-term`, now using an underscore

This was originally code which was extracted from
[lscolors](https://github.com/ziglibs/lscolors) for use in
other zig libraries. More features have been added since.

`ansi_term` is designed to work with Zig 0.14.0.
